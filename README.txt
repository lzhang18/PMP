To run the demo, please run the attack_demo. We have two version of protection code:

run_protect.m: will run the protection algorithm with precompute distances in the time series.

run_protect_v2.m: will run the protection algorithm in the time series while computing the distance.

info_attack.m: The entropy based attack

loc_attack.m: The location based attack
